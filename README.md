### Challenges Encountered üöß

Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges. The most significant of these was working with the `DateTime` type and configuring timezones within the application. Here are the key issues and how they impacted the development:

### 1. DateTime and Timezone Configuration ‚è∞

**Issue:** Handling the `DateTime` type and configuring timezones proved to be quite challenging. 

- **Unexpected Validation Errors:** I faced errors related to validations that were thrown unexpectedly. These errors were often linked to discrepancies between timezones, which caused issues with date and time comparisons and validations.

- **Timezone Consistency:** Ensuring that the application handled timezones consistently across different components was another major hurdle. Inconsistent timezone settings led to incorrect timestamps and validation failures.

**Resolution:** To address these challenges, I:
- **Standardized Timezones:** Configured the application to use a consistent timezone across all environments.
- **Refined Validations:** Updated validation logic to account for timezone differences and ensure accurate date and time handling.

Despite these efforts, working with `DateTime` and timezone configuration remains a complex aspect of the application, and further refinements may be needed.

If you have any insights or suggestions on handling these issues, I‚Äôd love to hear them!


## Getting Started
- Ruby (version >= 3.2.2)
- Rails (version >= 7.1.3.2)
- PostgreSQL
### Installation
1. `git clone`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rails db:create` `rails db:seed`
### Usage
Start the server with:
`rails server`
### Testing
1. Run RSpec Tests üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Execute the RSpec tests with the following command: `bundle exec rspec`
2. Check Test Coverage üìä We use SimpleCov to measure test coverage. After running the tests, SimpleCov will generate a coverage report, typically located in the coverage directory. Open coverage/index.html in your browser to view the detailed coverage report.
3. Verify Test Results ‚úÖ You should see a total of 43 passing tests. Ensure that all tests pass to confirm that the application is functioning as expected.
4. Note on Dashboard Tests ‚ö†Ô∏è Please be aware that tests for the dashboard are still in progress, as they were part of a stretch goal. Some functionalities related to the dashboard may not yet be fully tested.

## Database Schema
```
create_table "reservations", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "name"
    t.integer "party_count"
    t.datetime "start_time"
    t.bigint "table_id", null: false
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
    t.index ["table_id"], name: "index_reservations_on_table_id"
  end

  create_table "tables", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.integer "capacity"
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
  end

  The "Create a Reservation" feature allows users to book a reservation at any time, 24/7. Below is a detailed overview of how the feature works and the validations in place.

### Key Features

- **24/7 Booking**: Users can make reservations at any time, provided that certain conditions are met.
- **Real-Time Availability Check**: Reservations can be made as long as:
  - There is no existing reservation for the same time slot.
  - The reservation is not for a past date or less than an hour from the current time.
  - The party size does not exceed the table‚Äôs capacity.

### Form Requirements

To ensure a valid reservation, all fields in the form are required. If any field is left blank, users will receive a notification within the form indicating that the field is required. The fields typically include:

1. **Name**: The name of the person making the reservation.
2. **Date and Time**: The desired date and time for the reservation.
3. **Party Size**: The number of people in the party.
4. **Contact Information**: Email address or phone number for confirmation.

### Validation Rules

- **Existing Reservation Check**: The system checks for existing reservations for the specified date and time. Users will be informed if the chosen slot is already booked.
- **Past Date/Time Validation**: Reservations cannot be made for dates and times that have already passed or for times less than an hour from the current time.
- **Table Capacity Check**: The system verifies that the party size does not exceed the table's capacity. Users will receive an error if the party size is too large.

### Error Handling

- **Field Validation**: If any required field is not filled out, the form will display a notification indicating that the field is required.
- **Time and Capacity Errors**: Users will receive specific error messages if their reservation request fails due to existing reservations, past date/times, or exceeding table capacity.
